# Letter-to-Code Converter

A simple Python script that converts words into a numerical code based on predefined letter mappings.

## Overview

In this project, letters are mapped to numbers as follows:

- C = 1
- A = 2
- M = 3
- P = 4
- H = 5
- O = 6
- R = 7
- W = 8
- I = 9
- E = 0

For example, the word "CAMPHOR" is converted to "1234567" and "WIRE" to "8970". This script allows you to find the code for any word based on this mapping.

## Features

- Convert any word into its corresponding numerical code.
- Easy to modify mappings for different requirements.

## Installation
